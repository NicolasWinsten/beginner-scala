# Example file for KCluster input. The first line holds the number of clusters we want to group our data into.
# The second line holds the number of data points from this set we want to use
# (could be used to split this data set into a training set and test set)
# The rest of this file should contain a data point on each line with however many components separated by a space.
# This example has data points of only two components.
# PRECONDITION: Every data point in this file should have the same number of components
